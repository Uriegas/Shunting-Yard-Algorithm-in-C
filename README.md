# Shunting-Yard-Algorithm-in-C
This is an old implementation of the Shunting Yard Algorithm in C

## Disclamer
**This is not code made by myself.**
The original code can be found now at: [Shunting yard algorithm (C)](https://web.archive.org/web/20101228154154/http://en.literateprograms.org/Shunting_yard_algorithm_%28C%29#chunk%20def:shunt_op) 
It is now in the Wayback Machine.

## P.D
Also in that [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20101228154154/http://en.literateprograms.org/Shunting_yard_algorithm_%28C%29#chunk%20def:shunt_op) there is a good documentation about the algorithm and the example code.

## Compile and Run
Just implemented a simple [Makefile](Makefile):
1. make
2. ./ShuntingYard.out
